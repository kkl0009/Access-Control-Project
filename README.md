# Access Control

This program was created for one of my cybersecurity classes. You can find instructions to run it below. 

It is intended to be run with a file containing commands in the proper syntax, as per the requirements of the assignment. See the example scenarios for some example outputs.

Each time the program is run, it will update the audit file with the result of every action that occurs, and it will also print each message to the terminal.

This program was created for Programming Assignment 2 for CS 465
It is intended to be run on the LCSEE Loud OVA, but should run just fine on any Linux OS

In order to run the program, you need only run:

	python3 access [filename]

Included are 2 folder, TestCase1 and TestCase2 containing the 2 test cases. They each include identical copies
of the access program file if you would like to run them for yourself. There is also an access copy at the top
level of this folder which you may test with any test cases you wish. The input files for each test case are
"test1.txt" and "test2.txt" respectively.
